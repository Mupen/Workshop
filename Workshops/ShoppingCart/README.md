# ShoppingCart

## Introduction
A backend shopping cart API built with C# using .NET 10.0. The project is structured using layered architecture separating domain logic, application use cases, persistence, and HTTP endpoints. It includes unit tests using xUnit and can be tested manually through Swagger.

The current version is backend only. There is no frontend yet.

---

## Assignment Requirements

- The system should represent a small online store with products
- The system should include a shopping cart
- The shopping cart should:
  - belong to a user id
  - contain different product items
  - track quantity for each item

- The backend should include endpoints for:
  - reading shopping carts
  - creating shopping carts
  - editing shopping carts
  - deleting shopping carts

- Quantity increase/decrease can be handled by a future frontend. The backend uses a practical set-item endpoint where quantity can be changed directly.

---

## Extras

- `.gitignore` for the project
- `README.md` for the project
- Layered architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API)
- SQLite database with EF Core migrations
- Swagger/OpenAPI for manual API testing
- Docker and Docker Compose support
- Development seed data
- Use of records for request and response DTOs
- Structured query and use case pattern
- Result pattern for expected business errors
- Unit tests for domain, application, query, and persistence behavior

## What I Built

I built a backend shopping cart API with a focus on clean architecture, business rules, persistence, and API testing through Swagger.

The project is structured into multiple layers:

```text
ShoppingCart.Api             Controllers, DTOs, Swagger, HTTP result mapping
ShoppingCart.Application     Use cases, queries, requests, read models, interfaces
ShoppingCart.Domain          Entities, enums, business rules, Result contracts
ShoppingCart.Infrastructure  EF Core, SQLite, migrations, repositories, seed data
ShoppingCart.UnitTests       Unit and persistence tests
```

The system currently supports:

- Product catalog with:
  - SKU, name, description, price, status, brand, and category
  - inventory tracking
  - stock quantity
  - availability calculation

- Product brands:
  - creating brands
  - renaming brands
  - listing and fetching brands

- Product categories:
  - root categories
  - child categories
  - renaming categories
  - moving categories

- Shopping carts:
  - creating a cart for a user id
  - listing all carts
  - fetching one cart by id
  - listing carts by user id
  - adding products to a cart
  - updating product quantity
  - removing a product by setting quantity to zero
  - deleting carts
  - calculating total quantity and total price

- SQLite persistence:
  - EF Core migrations
  - automatic migration on startup
  - development seed data

- Docker support:
  - Dockerfile
  - docker-compose.yml
  - Visual Studio Docker profile

The project also includes a user foundation:

- `User`
- `UserRole`
- user repository
- user use cases
- seeded demo users

This user code is only a placeholder for later authentication and authorization work. There is no login, no frontend account flow, no password hashing service, and no role-based controller authorization in this version.

The project includes unit tests verifying:

- product rules
- brand and category rules
- shopping cart behavior
- result contracts
- application use cases
- query behavior
- EF Core persistence behavior

---

## Why I Did It This Way

### Clean separation of concerns
I structured the system into layers to clearly separate responsibilities:

- Domain handles business rules
- Application coordinates use cases and queries
- Infrastructure handles database access
- API handles HTTP requests and responses

This makes the system easier to test, extend, and maintain.

---

### Backend-first API design
The assignment focuses on the shopping cart backend, so I built the backend API first and used Swagger as the manual testing interface.

This makes it possible to verify the API before building a frontend.

---

### Practical cart editing
Instead of creating separate endpoints for increasing and decreasing quantities, the API has one endpoint for setting the item quantity:

```text
PUT /api/shopping-carts/{id}/items
```

If the quantity is greater than zero, the item is added or updated. If the quantity is zero, the item is removed. This matches the assignment idea that a future frontend can decide how the user changes quantities.

---

### Read models and response DTOs
Instead of exposing domain entities directly, the API returns response DTOs.

For products, the response includes display-friendly values such as:

- brand name
- category name
- availability

This keeps the domain model clean while making the API easier to use from Swagger or a future frontend.

---

### Use case-driven logic
Operations are handled through explicit use cases, such as:

- creating products
- changing product price
- creating shopping carts
- setting shopping cart items
- deleting shopping carts

This keeps business workflows centralized and reusable.

---

### SQLite for simple local persistence
SQLite was used because the workshop project should be easy to run without installing a separate database server.

The API creates and migrates the database automatically when it starts.

---

### Docker support
Docker was added so the API can be run in a container and tested in a more realistic environment.

The project supports:

- command-line Docker Compose
- Visual Studio Docker launch profile

---

### Incremental development
The system was built step by step:

1. Core domain entities and rules
2. Application use cases and queries
3. EF Core persistence and migrations
4. API controllers and DTOs
5. Swagger/manual testing
6. Docker support
7. Documentation cleanup

This made it easier to validate each part before moving forward.

## Run Locally

From the repository root:

```powershell
dotnet run --project Workshops\ShoppingCart\ShoppingCart.Api\ShoppingCart.Api.csproj --launch-profile http
```

Open Swagger:

```text
http://localhost:5088/swagger
```

---

## Run With Docker

From the repository root:

```powershell
docker compose -f Workshops\ShoppingCart\docker-compose.yml up --build
```

Open Swagger:

```text
http://localhost:5088/swagger
```

Stop Docker:

```powershell
docker compose -f Workshops\ShoppingCart\docker-compose.yml down
```

Reset the Docker database volume:

```powershell
docker compose -f Workshops\ShoppingCart\docker-compose.yml down -v
```

---

## Build And Test

```powershell
dotnet build Workshops\ShoppingCart\ShoppingCart.Api\ShoppingCart.Api.csproj --no-restore
dotnet build Workshops\ShoppingCart\ShoppingCart.UnitTests\ShoppingCart.UnitTests.csproj --no-restore
dotnet test Workshops\ShoppingCart\ShoppingCart.UnitTests\ShoppingCart.UnitTests.csproj --no-build --no-restore
```

## AI Disclosure
This project was written by Daniel Henriksen. ChatGPT (AI by OpenAI) was used as a collaborative tool throughout the process.

My workflow was to build and shape the project through my own decisions, then use ChatGPT to:

- identify architectural improvements
- debug issues and trace errors
- review API behavior
- refine structure and naming
- assist with Docker setup
- assist with documentation and explanations

All core logic, structure, and design decisions are my own work.
ChatGPT acted as a reviewer and technical assistant.
